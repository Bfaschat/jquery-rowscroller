jQuery Row Scrolling Plugin
==========

I recently had a project where I needed to scroll over multiple rows of thumbnails. I needed this functionality on a couple pages of the web site. I didnâ€™t need all the complexity of all the fancy scrollers that are out there now, so I decided to make my own plugin.
